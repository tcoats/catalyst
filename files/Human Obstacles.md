## Human Instincts:
### Safety
We naturally seek to stay safe when faced with certainty. Are you moving?

### Emotion
We use our emotions before we consider reason to guide our choices.  Are you making choices to please people you care about?

### Bias
We are naturally wired for bias. Sometimes we make choices based on how we see the world not,how it is.
### Belonging
As humans we seek to belong.  Do you care about the same things as they do?

### Memory
Our memory fades.  Have you repeating experiences to learn more?

###Over Confidence
Our natural approach is to operate with confidence over realism.  Have you done the slow thinking?

### Limited Energy
Our brains have limited energy.  Does this work activity spark or dim your energy?
